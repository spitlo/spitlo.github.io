# Spitlo.github.io (spitlo.com)

This is my personal website, generated by [Zola](https://getzola.org) and hosted with GitHub pages under a custom domain (<https://spitlo.com>).

## To do

- [x] Use `word_count` to decide whether to show a TOC or not
- [x] ~~Create GitHub action that deploys site only when editing files directly in GitHub. Possible?~~ Use `workflow_dispatch` to enable deploys from GitHub
- [x] Update the ~~`balls`~~ `shapes` macro to take a ~~`shape`~~ `type` argument, to match the squares and triangles of the header and footer
- [ ] Finish tags page
- [x] In the heel, always put a right-aligned `$white` shape to connect with the "cloud" in the footer
