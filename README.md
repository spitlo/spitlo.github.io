# Spitlo.github.io (spitlo.com)

This is my personal website, generated by [Zola](https://getzola.org) and hosted with GitHub pages under a custom domain (<spitlo.com>).

## To do

- [ ] Use `word_count` to decide whether to show a TOC or not
- [ ] Create GitHub action that deploys site only when editing files directly in GitHub. Possible?
- [ ] Update the `balls` macro to take a `shape` argument, to match the squares and triangles of the header and footer.
