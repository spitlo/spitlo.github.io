I decided to do looptober AGAIN! This year I will be using the [Woovebox](https://www.woovebox.com/). I bought it awhile back but I haven’t really given it a good try yet.

My prediction for this year is even more stuff in the same key, scale and BPM, because of how the Woovebox works. Or really because of how lazy I am. I really don’t like using bluetooth for transfer, so I won’t be backing up and resetting the Woovebox very often. That gives me at most 16 different sets of key/scale/BPM/instrumentation. I will be reusing those I’m most happy with.

Another consequence of my dislike of bluetooth is I won’t be bouncing and exporting tracks off the Woovebox. I will record them straight to Reaper from the line out through a Rode AI-Micro. Hopefully this won’t effect the sound quality negatively.
