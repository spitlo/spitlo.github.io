I found some old songs of mine that somebody had uploaded to the tube. They're probably downloaded from the old spitlo.com, which had a spoof MySpace page with a few songs on it. There are some weird skips in the first song, but until I work up the energy to find better versions and upload them here (and perhaps recreate the old MySpace spoof?) I thought it’d be fun to repost them.
