Looptober? Why not! I saw it mentioned somewhere, but I couldnâ€™t really find any "rules" so I decided to just try to create one loop a day for the month of October as a way of getting to know the Elektron Syntakt. Below are the fruits of this labor.

NB: Since these are made to be played in a loop, they are not playable with the `:play` command. Just use the play button.

## 01 - Duckboy (86 BPM)
