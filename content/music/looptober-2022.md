Looptober? Why not! I saw it mentioned somewhere, but I couldnâ€™t really find any "rules" so I decided to just try to create one loop a day for the month of October as a way of getting to know the Elektron Syntakt. Below are the fruits of that labor.

NB: These are made to be played in a loop, but if you only want a quick peek they are still playable using the `:play` command.

## 01 - Duckboy (86 BPM)

{{ looper(filepath="/audio/looptober/2022/01-duckboy.mp3") }}

## 02 - Grvyrdshft (72 BPM)

{{ looper(filepath="/audio/looptober/2022/02-grvyrdshft.mp3") }}

## 03 - Spacejoust (80 BPM)

{{ looper(filepath="/audio/looptober/2022/03-spacejoust.mp3") }}
