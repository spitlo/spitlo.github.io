I made this site mainly to improve my HTML and front-end skills, having done mostly back-end or React work the last few years.

I also wanted to try out [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) and get away from JavaScript for a while.

Lastly, I guess itâ€™s a nice low-stakes place to try stuff out and have fun, for example:

- GitHub hosting with a custom domain name
- For now, I deploy changes with a script in the `bin/` directory, but I want to try out GitHub actions, and this site would be a good candidate for automatic deploys
- Handcoded SVGs and programatically generated SVGs
- Undocumented CSS stuff like animating the `content` value of `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements
- Using AVIF[?](https://github.com/getzola/zola/issues/1202)
