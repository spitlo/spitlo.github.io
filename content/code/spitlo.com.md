I made this site mainly to improve my HTML and front-end skills, having done mostly React and back-end work the last few years.

I also wanted to try out [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) and get away from JavaScript for a while.

Lastly, itâ€™s a nice low-stakes place to have some fun and try stuff out, for example:

- GitHub Pages hosting with a custom domain name
- GitHub Actions
- Handcoded or programatically generated SVGs
- Undocumented CSS stuff like animating the `content` value of `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements
- Newer/partially supported HTML elements like `<details>`
- Ever so slightly dipping my toes into the Rust ecosystem
- Using AVIF[?](https://github.com/getzola/zola/issues/1202)
