Rotnot tries to figure out the notes of sound samples based on their filename, and save that note as meta data in the file.

At the moment it works on a bunch of multi sampled instruments I had available, where the filename were either:

- Note+octave (`a#4.wav`)
- Collection_name-note+octave (`MutedTrumpet-Bb2.wav`); or
- The actual midi note (`031.wav`)

The midi note is then written back to the wave file as part of the "Sampler Chunk", in the `MIDI Unity Note` field.

(TODO: The "Instrument Chunk" har a field with similar purpose, `MIDI Unshifted Note`. Consider writing to that as well.)

## Rationale

I own a 1010music blackbox hardware sampler. It can load a folder of samples as a multi-sample instrument, but it doesnâ€™t use filenames for note recognition. So I use this to prepare sample packs before moving them to the SD card.
