Karakter is a Bash script that takes text input (either from a pipe, as plain text arguments or as a file) and adds a little character to the text by substituting visually similar glyphs for letters a-z and A-Z. I wrote it because I wanted to come up with a pretty basic cli that I could then convert to other languages that I’ve been wanting to try out, like [Ada](https://www.adaic.org/) and [Fortran](https://fortran-lang.org/). I encourage everyone to not hold their breath for that though -- at the moment there is a working (I think) version in [V](https://vlang.io) and work-in-progress versions in [Inko](https://inko-lang.org/), [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/), [Odin](https://odin-lang.org/), [Vale](https://vale.dev/) and [Zig](https://ziglang.org/)

There is a default style that’s sort of a kitchen sink mix of very different looking glyphs, and then there’s five less eclectic styles, `¢џБ≡┎pμ∩κ`, `ƒάїгψłάľє`, `LŌŪĐMŌŪṪH`, `₥0₦€¥₸₳£₭` and `num83r5`.

Most glyphs are chosen from [this list](https://github.com/ehmicky/cross-platform-terminal-characters) of "All the characters that work on most terminals" so they should work on most terminals -- the exception being the set "Moneytalk" which is made up entirely of currency symbols (plus `1` and `0`, of course) and is not guaranteed to work everywhere.

There are some other flags, but the project readme has more information.

## Usage examples

Generate a mildly elvish version of your name for an email signature using the Bash version:

```bash
bash/karakter --md --ft John Doe
```

Turn A Tale of Two Cities into a cyberpunk novel using the V version and read it comfortably in your terminal:

```bash
curl https://www.gutenberg.org/files/98/98-0.txt | sed 's/one thousand seven/two thousand seven/g' | tr a-z A-Z | v/karakter -o md -s cp | less
```

## Output examples

### Input text

```txt
It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way – in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.
