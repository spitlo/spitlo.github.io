Karakter is a bash script that takes text input (either from a pipe, as plain text arguments or as a file) and adds a little character to the text by substituting visually similar glyphs for letters a-z and A-Z. I wrote it because I wanted to come up with a pretty basic cli that I could then convert to other languages that I’ve been wanting to try out, like Ada and Fortran. I encourage everyone to not hold their breath for that though.

There is a default style that’s sort of a kitchen sink mix of very different looking glyphs, and then there’s two less eclectic styles, `¢џБ≡┎pμ∩κ` and `ƒάїгψłάľє`.

All glyphs are chosen from [this list](https://github.com/ehmicky/cross-platform-terminal-characters) of "All the characters that work on most terminals" so they should work on most terminals.

There are some other flags, but the project readme has more information.

## Output examples

### Input text

```txt
It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way – in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.
```

### Output text, obfuscation level low, default style
