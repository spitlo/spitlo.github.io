PIKSEQ is an experiment in sequencing. It’s sort of a mix between a pixel art editor and a sequencer.

PIKSEQ is available online at [spitlo.com/pikseq/](https://spitlo.com/pikseq/).

PIKSEQ also has a sibling, [Sikwent](/code/sikwent/), available online at [spitlo.com/sikwent/](https://spitlo.com/sikwent/), and a cousin, [Space](/code/space/), available online at [spitlo.com/space/](https://spitlo.com/space/).

You pick a color by clicking the color buttons or by pressing keys `1` to `9`. Then start painting! You can only paint by clicking a pixel at a time, sorry :( It’s more like Lego and less like painting.

To help you paint more efficiently, there are some keyboard modifiers. If you press `alt`/`option` while painting a pixel, you will get a horizontal line. If you press `shift` while painting a pixel, you will get a vertical line. Lines extend through all pixels of the same color, so you can put a start and end pixel and the line will cover the area between them. If you press `windows`/`command`/`meta` (depending on your OS) at the same time, the line will only paint every other pixel.

You can mute individual tracks by using keys `a` to `z` on your keyboard. Or by clicking/tapping the track note.

There are also a few palettes for you to choose between.
