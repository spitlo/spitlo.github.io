        <p>
          I’ve always wanted to make games, but it’s hard! Especially since I immediately try to make a new Monkey Island or Blackwell Pentalogy and get paralyzed by the sheer amount of work involved. This section is an attempt to remedy that by making many smaller games, and not necessarily waiting for them to be done before releasing them.

        <p>
          There’s only one game here at the moment, and it’s very much a work in progress.
